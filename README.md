Quick prototype featuring two opposing armies tasked with protecting their village from the waking Minotaur

Repel the beast by bashing it with shields

The mighty bull will start to see red and charge if this happens too much

Be careful, your shields are only strong from the front. If the minotaur gets around or through your shields then be prepared to lose some men!
